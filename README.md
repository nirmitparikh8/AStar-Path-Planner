# AStar-Path-Planner
This repository demonstrates path planning using the A* algorithm for a mobile robot navigating through a maze-like environment. Matlab generates a scenario with walls and obstacles, plans a path from a specified start position to a goal position, and simulates the robot's movement along the planned path.
